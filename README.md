#### Ghost overtime
To illustrate how the timer behaves with default settings:
Ghost overtime kicks in at 15 seconds on the clock and will add a maximum of 45 seconds to the round. This gives us a total of 15 + 45 = 60 seconds for the timer of 15 seconds to decay. 60 / 15 = 4, meaning each second on the clock during ghost overtime will last for 4 real seconds.

    * Ghost is picked up at 15 seconds and is held for 16 seconds. The timer shows 10 (15 - 16/4 = 11, rounded down to 10 for simplicity).
    * The ghost is dropped, making the timer speed up.
    * 8 seconds later the ghost is picked up again. Since grace reset is enabled, the timer jumps from 2 to 8 seconds (10 - 8/4 = 8).
